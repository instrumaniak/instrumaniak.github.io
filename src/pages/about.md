Hi! This is Raziur Rahman. I am from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I studied Electrical and Electronic Engineering (B.Sc, 2009) from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, Dhaka. Currently working as a web developer, mostly coding in JavaScript (React & Node.js).

In this blog/personal site I will be sharing my thoughts, experience and experiments about things that I find interesting or worth sharing!
